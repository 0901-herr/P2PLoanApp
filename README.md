## Inspiration
The current financial landscape often excludes gig economy workers from accessing essential credit services due to irregular income and lack of formal employment verification. Recognizing that 50% of gig workers struggle financially and 78% have less than $500 in emergency savings, we were inspired to create a solution that addresses these challenges and promotes financial inclusion for this underserved population.

## What It Does
LLto is a tailored P2P micro-lending platform designed specifically for gig workers. It provides flexible loan terms ranging from 1 to 3 months with amounts from $0 to $2000. Our platform features lower fees compared to traditional financial institutions and offers a custom credit scoring system that considers the unique income patterns of gig workers. LLto simplifies the application process with minimal documentation requirements, ensuring quick and easy access to funds for both stable and fluctuating income earners. Additionally, LLto benefits lenders by providing instant returns on their investments, making it an attractive option for individuals looking to support gig workers while earning quick returns.

## How We Built It
We developed LLto as a mobile application using React Native and Tailwind CSS for the front end. Firebase handles authentication and database storage. Our development process involved setting up the necessary environments, building core functionalities for lending and borrowing, and ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience. We enhanced the app's utility by including a PayScreen with a card design that simulates a credit card, allowing users to transfer, deposit, and conduct payments all within the app.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Addressing the default risk associated with lending to gig workers by developing a custom credit scoring system that accurately assesses gig workers' creditworthiness.
- Incentivizing timely repayments by rewarding borrowers with an increased credit score for early repayment and penalizing them for late payments to encourage responsible borrowing behavior.
- Ensuring robust security measures to prevent fraud while maintaining a seamless user experience.
- Integrating various functionalities, such as real-time data updates and secure authentication, required meticulous attention to detail.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Developing a platform that promotes financial inclusion, providing gig workers with access to essential financial services.
- Successfully creating a custom credit scoring system tailored to gig workers' needs and implementing an intuitive user interface.
- Devising a solution that benefits both borrowers and lenders.
- Ensuring the platform's scalability to meet the increasing demands of the global gig economy.

## What We Learned
- Understanding the unique financial challenges faced by gig workers and tailoring solutions to meet their needs.
- Developing scalable and secure applications, building from scratch, problem-solving, and working effectively as a team.
- Combining business models and generating innovative ideas by referencing other successful businesses.
- Analyzing various business strategies to identify beneficial practices to incorporate into our platform.

## What's Next for LLto
- Expanding LLto's reach by partnering with more merchants to provide additional benefits for our users.
- Offering a wider variety of loan types and expanding services beyond gig workers to include credit card users and buy-now-pay-later users.
- Becoming a job-searching site for gig workers, potentially retaining more funds within our app and offering benefits to employers who pay workers' salaries through our platform.
- Enhancing our AI-driven customer support and continuously optimizing our revenue model.
- Ultimately, envisioning LLto as a comprehensive financial solution, promoting financial stability and empowerment for a broader user base.
